# Sample-Rest-API

  This Sample Rest API service has published by Ahmet Kunduraci to show OLEV managers how a rest api service works simply. So that I could join their team :)

  Note that this repo will be removed soon.

# Testing service

  The project uses connection on the localhost MongoDB instance (Default). To reach endpoints you can import the Olev.postman_collection file on the root directory to the PostMan (Chrome Extension)

  - Clone the repo
  - run "npm install" command on the terminal
  - run "npm test" command
